name
       Simple notification daemon

SYNOPSIS
       snotifd


DESCRIPTION
       snotifd is a simple daemon meant to run per user, which can receive and
       store  notifications  via  DBus  in  memory.  All notifications will be
       cleared on restart of the daemon.

       It is a quite straight forward program, you start it, and  it  will  be
       listening  to  the DBus, the intended way to interact with it is to use
       snotifc(1) which implements the nesecarry functions to connect via  the
       snotifd.Notifications DBus-interface.

       It can be built with

              make

       after which you can install it to your user with

              make

       Then you can run

              systemctl --user enable --now snotifd

       to  start  it if you are on a systemd-system.  If not, you can start it
       with ~/bin/snotifd.  snotifc is installed to ~/bin/snotifc.  Make  sure
       that is in your path to be able to execute it.
